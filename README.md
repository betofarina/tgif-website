In this course, I am a developer at Code of the Web, a small software shop that creates custom JavaScript-based web applications. Transparent Government in Fact (TGIF), a non-partisan non-profit organization working to increase the publicâ€™s involvement in government, has hired me to develop a Congressional tracking web site for them. I worked on this web application using modern JavaScript technologies, including AJAX, JSON, and RESTful APIs.
